# Proxy Prototyping

The point of this codebase is to enable very quick prototyping of proxy code.

There are two modules:

 - `proxy` which is the simple prototype
 - `service` which is a rest api to act as a service

You run each of this in their own terminal from the project root:

 - `./runinstance.sh service 7000`
 - `./runinstance.sh proxy 6000`

By default, calls to 6000 will proxy to the same location at 7000.

You can change where the proxy will direct calls by sending a `host` query such as:

 - `curl http://localhost:6000?host=https://google.com`

This changes the target from the default `http://localhost:7000` to
`https://google.com`.  Once this is done you do not need to pass the
`host` query flag again to talk to `google.com`
